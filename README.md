## MACHINE LEARNING by STANFORD(Andrew Ng)
This repository is about assignments of [coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) by Andrew Ng(Professor in Stanford Univ.). All code is written with Matlab(Octave).
I strongly recommend that you write your own code and I hope this code would help you break through to write right code. Discussion is always welcome. yangjy0113@gmail.com
